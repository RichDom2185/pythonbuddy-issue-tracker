# Python Buddy Issue Tracker

[Python Buddy](https://learn.richarddominick.me/python/) is a tool to help you learn coding in Python. It explains how to read and better understand Python code in a step-by-step fashion.

This repository is for tracking issues and feature requests for Python Buddy.

## Features and Roadmap

- [x] Step-by-step explanations of Python code
- [x] Code highlighting
- [x] Code editing
- [ ] (WIP) Sharable links
- [ ] Code execution visualization

## Supported Python Features

I'm actively working on supporting more and more features of the language, with the goal of covering the necessary features for basic Python learning first. Here's what's currently supported, as well as the features I'm working on next:

- [x] Variable assignment: `a = 1`
- [x] Lists, tuples, and dictionaries: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- [x] Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
- [x] Comparisons: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `in`, `not in`, `is`, `is not`
- [x] Operator assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`, `**=`
- [ ] Boolean operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- [x] Ternary operator: `a if b else c`
- [x] If statements: `if`, `elif`, `else`
- [x] While loops: `while True`
- [x] For loops: `for x in my_list:`
- [ ] Non-standard control flow: `break` and `continue` statements
- [x] List comprehensions: `[x for x in my_list]`
- [ ] Dictionary comprehensions: `{x: x for x in my_list}`
- [ ] Set comprehensions: `{x for x in my_list}`
- [ ] Generator expressions: `(x for x in my_list)`
- [x] Function definitions: `def my_func(a, b, c):`
- [x] Function calls: `my_func(a, b, c)`
- [ ] Early `return` statements
- [x] Attribute/method access: `my_list.append(1)`
- [ ] Import statements: `import numpy as np`
